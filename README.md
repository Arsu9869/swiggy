This is the Swiggy project. You can still make some changes like adding an extra pagination slide at the "What's on your mind section of the page".

You can also add more cuisines such that when we click on the more option , a new slide comes up(using javascript, we need make this slide's visibility: visible) 

Also if you look at the real swiggy page, there is an "Restaurants with online food delivery in Bangalore" section,you can add that as well if you are interested.

The css code that is written can be shortened, i will do that later.

i have mostly used "dispaly : flex"   css option as it was mostly used for all the the elements in the real website as well.

You can make whatever changes you want to the page,try adding more transitions,box-shadows etc

I will be trying to make a login page as well.

If anybody is interested ,you could make the  "Restaurants with online food delivery in Bangalore" section.
